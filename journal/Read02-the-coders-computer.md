## The Text Editor
Text Editors are perhaps the most important vehicle through which developers create and implement their projects, as they allow direct access to the inner workings and "guts" of a webpage, as well as director management of the content. There are several critical features in popular text editors that can help you to work your code with ease:

1. The first hugely-important feature of a Text Editor to look out for is a *code completion* ability. This feature helps to reduce the chances of human errors and typos, which happen to even the most eagle-eyed code editors, by automatically displaying suggested commands and code to finish whatever line you're typing at that moment. Think of it as an auto-complete feature, minus the Google searching.

1. Secondly, keep an eye out for text editors with *syntax highlighting*. This handy feature uses a system of colors to differentiate different lines and elements of code - making for a much simpler navigation of a long document or page. Even more importantly, it can help to highlight errors and squash those infuriating bugs!

1. Third, a wide selection of available extensions, when needed, is key - these plugins can help to "turbo charge" your code with features that might not be available in your software's base system.
