### The Growth Mindset

The **growth mindset** is key to success in a fast-paced learning environment. This mindset is a set of beliefs and processes that will help you adapt and overcome obstacles. Rather than folding when running into seemingly-insurmountable difficulties, those in a growth mindset use the challenges presented to them as fuel to power further development and push through the metaphorical roadblock. 

In the [words of the immortal Peppy Hare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txWWi2n76FI) in the 1997 Nintendo classic *Star Fox 64*:

> *"Never give up! Trust your instincts!"*

Making sure you keep up the growth mindset ensures that nothing can stand in your way. Always remember:

- Seek out challenges - don't run from them. Adversity creates opportunity for development.
- Every problem you solve becomes a benchmark by which you can quantify your growth and future success.
- Learning a new skill is *always* possible. Every person who has ever come before you started somewhere.
