# Designing Web Pages with CSS

## Selected notes from readings in *HTML & CSS* by Jon Duckett

### Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS

#### Key Concepts
* CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"
* CSS controls how the content of an element should appear on a page (color, font, etc)
* Associates rules with different HTML elements

### Chapter 11 - Color

#### Key Concepts
* Color is a critical way of bringing websites to life and attract your target audience
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own "box"
* These boxes can then be colored and modified accordingly
* Color pickers can help you find a specific color
* Contrast between text/background on a page is key to making content readable to visitors

##### Specifying Color in CSS

There are three different methods for specifying color in CSS:

1. RGB values: These values specify how much red, blue, and green make up a color. 

Example: rgb(100, 100, 10)

2. Hex codes: These six-digit codes represent the amount of red, green, and blue in a color, preceded by a hash/pound.

Example: #ee3e80

3. Color names: These use the names of 147 different predefined colors recognized by browsers.

Example: DarkCyan, Blue, LightBlue
