# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?
You may have heard the phrase "markup", but you best be ready to get mark*down* with markdown. Markdown is a simplistic syntax that focuses on *ease* of writing, reading, and generating HTML, making it much more accessible to beginners and pros alike. One of the most useful aspects of Markdown is the fact that users do not need much, if any, coding experience in order to use it.

Markdown uses simple characters - of the non-alphabetic variety - to add flavor and formatting to a document of otherwise plain text. For example, placing a single asterisk on either side of a piece of text, whether that be a single word or an entire paragraph, will automatically make that text italicized. For example:
```*I love coding.*``` 
So do I! This will be displayed as *I love coding*, thanks to the power of markdown.

On the opposite side of the font spectrum, a double asterisk will make text **bold**. So, in order to replicate the previous example in this new format, you'd use the following code:
```**I love coding.**```
Result? **I love coding.**

For a real throwback experience, all the way to the beginning of this article, let's briefly exploring header. We can automatically accomplish different levels and sizes of headers with varying quantities of the "pound/#" sign, with the number of pound signs corresponding to the heading number. So, to replicate my excellent "Learning Markdown" title above, we'd use the code ```# Learning Markdown```. You'll notice that you only need the pound sign at the *beginning* of the header text to get the desired effect. The "What is Markdown" section, as a lowly header 2, would be written as ```## What is Markdown?```. 

It's so intuitive, I'm sure you can discern the rest! Such is the beauty and power of Markdown - as it's made the inner workings of this page accessible to the unititated (like myself!) on the very first go.
