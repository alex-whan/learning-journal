# Computer Architecture and Logic

#### What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

* Ultimately, a computer is a **tool** to help us solve problems - though by manipulating information rather than the physical world
* Computers started out as non-electronic calculating devices

#### Key Terms

* **Algorithm**: a series of commands 
* **Binary**: a simple 0/1, on/off, yes/no, true/false system - but it can be used to count to any number or represent any word/image/sound
* **Bit**: the smallest piece of information a computer can store (determined by a single wire)

#### Key Concepts

* All computers have four basic functions:
    * Take Input -> 
    * Store Information -> 
    * Process Information -> 
    * Output Results
* All commands can be processed in **binary code** - the most basic part of software
