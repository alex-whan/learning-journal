# Programming with JavaScript

## Foundational pieces of JavaScript for Code 201:
* Functions
* Loops
* Arrays
* Conditionals

Computers **only** do what you tell them to do, exactly **how** you tell them to do it, and need **very** specific instructions in order to do so.

## JavaScript Basics

JavaScript makes pages more **interactive**:
* Accesses Content: Selects any element/attribute/text from HTML
* Modify Content: Add elements/attributes/text from HTML
* Program Rules: Specify steps for browser to follow
* React to Events: Specify what script should run when a specific event occurs

Examples of JavaScript in Browsers:
* Slideshows
* Forms
* Reloading/refreshing parts of page
* Filtering data/results

## Key Concepts

**Scripts**: Scripts are series of instructions for a computer to follow

**Flowcharts**: Sketch out scripts using flowcharts to show paths between each step

**Expressions**: Evaluate/result into a single value
* Expressions that assign a value to a variable
 ```var color = 'beige'```
* Expressions that use two or more variables to return a single value
```var area = 3*2```

**Operators**: Allow expressions to work and programmers to create one value from one or more values
* *Assignment operators* assign value to a variable
``` color = 'beige'```
* *Arithmetic operators* perform basic math
```area = 3*2```
* *String operators* combine two strings
```greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly';```

**Functions**: a series of *statements* grouped together to perform a specific task
* Can be re-used to repeat the same task
* Existing code is wrapped in curly braces ```{ }``` to make a function

**Statements**: the individual instructions/steps in a function

**Calling a Function**: asking a function to perform its task (must be named in order for it to work)

**Code Block**: One or more statements contained within curly braces (no semicolon after closing brace)

**Parameters**: Pieces of information passed to a function to allow it to achieve a task (like *width* or *height*)

**Return Value**: the response/answer given by a function

### Functions

* Naming a function: Function names can be anything, as long as you use the same names whenever you invoke them (cannot be the same as a variable name)

* Functions will be read by JS but won't actually be run until they are invoked

* **Parameters**: Go in the invocations

* **Arguments**: Happen when you actually *call* a function

### Functions in Code: Layout

Top to Bottom:

TOP: Global Variables
MIDDLE: Function Declarations
BOTTOM: Function Invocations

**Function Invocation**: ```functionName();```
