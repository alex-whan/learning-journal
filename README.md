# Code Fellows - Code 102 Learning Journal

### About Me

Hey there! My name is Alex, and I'm a student in Code Fellows' Code 102 course. A born-and-raised Washingtonian, I've long been interested in learning to code thanks to the thriving technology industry in my beautiful hometown of Seattle. Pacific Northwest is best, as they say.
