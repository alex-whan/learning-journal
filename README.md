### About Me

Hey there! My name is Alex, and I'm a student in Code Fellows' Code 102 course. A born-and-raised Washingtonian, I've long been interested in learning to code thanks to the thriving technology industry in my beautiful hometown of Seattle. Pacific Northwest is best, as they say.

After several years in the travel industry, where I indulged in my deep passion for exploring the world by developing and leading programs in the former Soviet Union, and had the pleasure of experiencing lesser-visited locations from Iran to Turkmenistan, I've finally found the opportunity to dedicate myself to web development as a career. This re-orientation is a huge change for me, and I'm ready to embrace it with open arms.

As someone fascinated by linguistics and languages, especially their acquisition and development, writing code is a perfect analogy for learning a new language. There are countless similarities between human and coding languages, and that's a huge part of what makes the field so absorbing - coding languages are ultimately a human construct, which means that everyone has the power to use them to create.

My personal pursuits including gaming (I'm a dedicated fan of Nintendo products), captaining my beloved Underdog flag football team (four-time league champs!), and taking in the natural beauty of every continent on Earth (currently on a quest to visit as many U.S. National Parks as possible). 

### Growth Mindset
The "growth mindset" is key to success in a fast-paced learning environment. This mindset is a set of beliefs and processes that will help you adapt and overcome obstacles. Rather than folding when running into seemingly-insurmountable difficulties, those in a growth mindset use the challenges presented to them as fuel to power further development and push through the metaphorical roadblock. 

In the words of the immortal Peppy Hare in the 1997 Nintendo classic *Star Fox 64*:

> *"Never give up! Trust your instincts!"*

Making sure you keep up the **growth mindset** ensures that nothing can stand in your way. Always remember:

- Seek out challenges - don't run from them. Adversity creates opportunity for development.
- Every problem you solve becomes a benchmark by which you can quantify your growth and future success.
- Learning a new skill is *always* possible. Every person who has ever come before you started somewhere.
