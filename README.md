### Growth Mindset
The "growth mindset" is key to success in a fast-paced learning environment. This mindset is a set of beliefs and processes that will help you adapt and overcome obstacles. Rather than folding when running into seemingly-insurmountable difficulties, those in a growth mindset use the challenges presented to them as fuel to power further development and push through the metaphorical roadblock. 

In the words of the immortal Peppy Hare:

> "Never give up! Trust your instincts!"

Making sure you keep up the "growth mindset" ensures that nothing can stand in your way. Always remember:

- Seek out challenges - don't run from them. Adversity creates opportunity for development.
- Every problem you solve becomes a benchmark by which you can quantify your growth and future success.
- Learning a new skill is *always* possible. Every person who has ever come before you started somewhere.
